Its location determines the qiblah (Arabic: قِبْلَة‎, direction of prayer).</p>

It was the third mosque built in the history of Islam,[a] and is now one of the largest mosques in the world. It is the second-holiest site in Islam, after the Great Mosque in Mecca.[8] It is always open, regardless of date or time.The site was originally adjacent to Muhammad's house; he settled there after his migration from Mecca to Medina in 622. He shared in the heavy work of construction. The original mosque was an open-air building</p>

                <p class="img-p">Mount Arafat or Mount Arafah (Arabic: جَبَل عَرَفَات‎ transliterated Jabal ‘Arafāt) is a granite hill about 20 km (12 mi) east of central Mecca in the plain of Arafat.[1] Mount Arafat reaches about 70 m (230 ft) in height and is also known as the "Mount of Mercy" (Arabic: جَبَل ٱلرَّحْمَة‎, translit. Jabal ar-Rahmah). According to Islamic tradition, the hill is the place where the Prophet Muhammed stood and delivered the Farewell Sermon to the Muslims who had accompanied him for the Hajj towards the end of his life. Muslims also say that it is also the place where Adam and Hawa reunited on earth after falling from Heaven. It is the place where Adam was forgiven, hence it is also known as the "Mount of Mercy". A pillar is erected to show the place where the aforementioned took place​.</p>
